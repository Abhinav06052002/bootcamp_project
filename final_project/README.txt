In this project the following features are incorporated:

- Running the __init__.py will give a link and start running on the browser.
- This application can be used by multiple persons. 
- This application is designed for a single week's task management starting from Monday.
- Selecting a particular day will show the list of activities planned for that day and an option to add activities.
Depending on the due time and time at the moment, the status will be shown as 'overdue' or 'pending'.
- If a planned task is completed, the 'DONE' button adjacent to the task can be clicked to remove it from the list.
